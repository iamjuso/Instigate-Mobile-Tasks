# Instigate-Mobile-Tasks
This is a README file of Instigate Mobile's tasks written by Sofi Juguryan.

In this repository are 4 files, each consisting of bash scripts.

1. primenums.sh program finds 0 - n input range's prime numbers and outputs them.
After running the script write n number as an input and see the output in terminal.

2. hwOsInfo.sh program outputs specific data about computer's HW info and OS info.
If you just run the script without giving arguments, it will output the flags usage guide (these allow you see specific parameters).

3. biggestDenominator.sh program takes two numbers as inputs and outputs their biggest denominator.

4. largestNum.sh program takes as many input numbers as the user wishes, and outputs the greatest number of all.
Please write spaces between input numbers.
